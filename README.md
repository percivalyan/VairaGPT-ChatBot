This project is a simple Flask-based web application that integrates the GPT-2 model using Hugging Face's Transformers library. It allows users to interact with the model via a chat interface, generating text responses. To run the project, install the necessary dependencies using pip install flask torch transformers flask-cors, then start the Flask server to use the chatbot locally.
